## Product inventory 
This project is part of the first RIWI training performance test, it is an inventory system, which allows us to apply the knowledge seen in the first weeks of training, Variabales, Variabales, 
Arithmetic, conditional operators, cycles, loops, enter others.

## Functionalities
1. Add products to the inventory: allow the user to add products with attributes such as
Name, price and quantity available.
2. Consult products in inventory: search for a product by name and show your
details (name, price, quantity).
3. Update product prices: modify the price of a specific product in the
inventory.
4. Eliminate inventory products: allow the elimination of a product that is no longer
available.
5. Calculate the total value of the inventory: multiply the price by the amount of each product
and show the accumulated total
---------

## Process 

To execute this program, first declare the dictionary with the products already default in the inventory, outside of which the user will add, then, I added a menu of options for the different functionalities that the program must meet, 
Then before defining each option of the menu, what I did was to make a number validation for each type of data that is going to be entered, so that it is an accepted number for the function, then it began to define each menu function, 
so that it can work properly for the user

------------------------------

## Examples of use 
Recall that one of the main functionalities that the program allows to add is to add new products, so what we could do serious:
- Enter two new products with their respective price and quantity.
- With the products already admitted to check as soon as the total inventory remains.
- Now eliminate one of the products, either from those recently admitted or those we already had.
- Finally review again as soon as the total inventory remains and thus confirm that the program meets its functionalities which are: *Add, eliminate, and bring proper use of the inventory.*
